I'm making a new github project to host the code for an article site I'm about to make. Why? I got challenged to make a django-related project and decided to take up the challenge!

This is to be more than just django source code. I'm going to try and publish the site on a subdomain of mine, get automated tests to run for new github pull requests and document the whole experience (This blog is the documentaiton part).
