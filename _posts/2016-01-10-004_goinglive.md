title: Going Live
---

It's come to the point where we have a basic 'hello world' + time working. Why time? It's a dynamic string and a quick refresh of the page will validate if the response is indeed coming from the server, or some strange static data. 

Now it's time to push this live. Hmm.. I think I'll re-use the scripts I had from my earlier TDD project. Ideally, I'd rather spend time customizing the scripts for this particular project, but for now, I'll just try using them as-is. 

The URL I'm planning for is : http://journal.abraham-v.com

Hmm.. I just realized. I didn't check the admin page on my dev server (Goes to check). Ookay. This is going to be an interesting challenge. I need to set a superuser for the admin page. I'm using sqlite as the DB. Hmm.. My earlier scripts (in the TDD project) were designed specifically without an admin page OR a superuser.

I'll add that as an issue to the issue tracker and put it on hold. Let me get my scripts and have the basic 'hello world' pushed out there first! :)
