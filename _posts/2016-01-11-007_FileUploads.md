The idea of file uploads makes me nervous. I can't quite pin-point why. Perhaps its because they are not served back from the database? Well, I suppose technically, you could try uploading files into a DB, but it would get very expensive to serve it out again, especially if the file was popular. 

Django supports a mechanism to allow files to be stored on the application server, but register a link into the model if its present. I'm not fully sure how the plumbing works, but it works. 

To get the setup working on a dev box is a matter of setting MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL in settings.py. There are a few more URL changes, but its all django-specific. The instructions change depending on what server you are using for the live site. In my case it is nginx. 

Since I'm not dealing with migrations, I'm taking an extreme step - remaking the DB each time. It's not really elegant, but it works.

Right now, I've got a dummy model which just stores files (or references to them?). Next is to update the model to store an actual article. And then, to add in a view to display the article.
