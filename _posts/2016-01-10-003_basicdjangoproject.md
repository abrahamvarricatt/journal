title: Basic Django project

I find myself wondering what exactly does a 'bare bones basic django project' mean? I've got enough code to get runserver up and running on my local system without issues. But there's no django app installed. Does it count?

Hmm.. It's probably borderline trivial, but I'm going to make an app too. Might as well bring this up to a respectable 'hello world' status before calling it 'basic'.
